HTML files of scraped sales navigator searches are stored here.
Each search has a folder.
Each folder has the HTML files of such a search.

In order to don't overwhelm your IDE with data and index files, place this folder in other location like `~/.appending`.
By default, all commands of **appending** will go to search data and index files into `~/.appending`.
